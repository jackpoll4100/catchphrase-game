# Catchphrase Game
Minimal browser app for playing the word game Catchphrase.

Rules work basically the same as regular Catchphrase, page is intended to be run on a phone so it can be passed around and keep the hot potato aspect of the game.

Word and phrase list is pulled from a few different places, and can be added to or modified by changing the payload in the js file.

Green button gets a random new word or phrase, red button stops the clock. Once the green button is pressed the clock starts, and it is given a semi random amount between 30 and 90 seconds. The page will make a ticking sound which gets faster in 30 second increments. A beeping sound plays for the last 10 seconds and an explosion will play when the timer runs out.
